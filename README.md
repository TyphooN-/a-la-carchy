# A La Carchy

**Pick and choose what you want to remove, à la carte style!**

![A La Carchy TUI](screenshots/A%20La%20Carchy.png)

A two-panel TUI (Terminal User Interface) debloater and optimizer for Omarchy Linux.

> **Requires a current Omarchy release** — one that configures Hyprland in Lua (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua`) and uses the Omarchy shell (Quickshell) for the bar, menus and notifications. Run `omarchy update` first if you are on an older install.

## Features

- **Two-panel TUI** with categories on the left and items on the right
- **Description bar** showing context for the currently highlighted item
- Interactive checklist of preinstalled packages and webapps
- Only shows packages and webapps that are currently installed
- **Themarchy** — generate and apply a cohesive theme from your current wallpaper with one keybind (SUPER+SHIFT+T)
- **246 extra community themes** browseable and installable with one click
- **Keybind Editor** to view and rebind all Hyprland keybindings via guided dialog
- **Hyprland Configurator** with 66 settings across 4 categories (General, Decoration, Input, Gestures)
- **Multi-monitor management** with detection, positioning, primary monitor, and laptop auto-off
- **ASUS ROG hardware control** via asusctl (platform profiles, Aura RGB, Slash Ledbar, fan curves, GPU MUX, battery management, power tuning, AniMe Matrix, and more)
- **30 configuration tweaks** for keybindings, display, system, appearance, keyboard, and utilities
- **Backup & restore** config directories with a single selection
- **Summary screen** after all actions complete
- Safe removal with confirmation prompts
- **No installation required** - just run the one-liner command!
- No external dependencies beyond what Omarchy ships (`jq`, `hyprctl`)

## Quick Start (One-Liner)

Just paste this command in your terminal and press Enter:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielCoffey1/a-la-carchy/master/a-la-carchy.sh)
```

That's it! The script will:
1. Show you a two-panel TUI with category navigation
2. Let you browse categories, select items, and configure tweaks
3. Execute your selections safely with confirmation prompts

## Alternative: Download and Run

If you prefer to download first:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielCoffey1/a-la-carchy/master/a-la-carchy.sh
chmod +x a-la-carchy.sh
./a-la-carchy.sh
```

## Requirements

- An AUR helper (`yay` or `paru`) recommended for full functionality
- `brightnessctl` for laptop display auto-off (preinstalled on Omarchy)
- `socat` or `nc` for real-time monitor plug/unplug events (falls back to polling if unavailable)
- `power-profiles-daemon` for power profile management (optional, shows error if unavailable)
- Battery with kernel `charge_control_end_threshold` support for battery charge limit (optional, shows error if unavailable)
- `asusctl` for ASUS ROG hardware control (optional, shows error if unavailable)
- `python-pywal` (AUR) for Themarchy wallpaper-based theming (optional, offered for install automatically)
- No other external dependencies - works out of the box!

## How to Use

1. Run the script using one of the methods above
2. Use the two-panel interface:
   - **←/→** Switch between the category panel (left) and items panel (right)
   - **↑/↓** Navigate within the current panel
   - **Space** Select/deselect items or edit a keybinding (in the right panel)
   - **A** Select/deselect all (Extra Themes only)
   - **R** Reset a pending keybinding edit (Keybind Editor only)
   - **Enter** Confirm and execute selected actions
   - **Q** Quit
3. Type `yes` when prompted to confirm
4. Choose **Apply all** at the master confirmation to skip individual prompts, or confirm each action one by one

## What It Does

### Configuration Tweaks

#### Keybinding Toggles

| Tweak | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Rebind close window | Changes SUPER+W to SUPER+Q |
| Bind/Unbind shutdown | SUPER+ALT+S for `systemctl poweroff` |
| Bind/Unbind restart | SUPER+ALT+R for `systemctl reboot` |
| Bind/Unbind theme menu | ALT+T for Omarchy theme selector |
| Swap Alt and Super keys | macOS-like modifier key layout |
| Restore Alt/Super keys | Return to default modifier layout |

#### Keybind Editor

A full keybinding editor that loads Omarchy's Hyprland bindings and displays them in a scrollable list organized by section (Tiling, Clipboard, Utilities, Media, Applications, User Bindings). Modified bindings are marked with a `*` prefix.

**Edit flow** — press Space on any binding to start a guided 3-step rebind:

1. **Modifier selection** — toggle SUPER, SHIFT, CTRL, ALT with Space, navigate with arrows
2. **Key input** — type a key name (e.g. Q, RETURN, F1) validated against known Hyprland keys
3. **Preview & confirm** — review the new binding before accepting; shows a **conflict warning** if the key combo is already bound to another action

Press `R` to reset a pending edit back to its current value.

On confirm, the editor writes `hl.unbind(...)` + `o.bind(...)` pairs to a managed `keybind-edits` block at the end of `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`. The binding's original action is copied verbatim, so rebinding never changes what a key does. Existing overrides are detected and shown in place, and moving a binding back to its original key removes its override.

Loop-generated bindings (such as the per-workspace keys) are not listed, since they can't be rebound one at a time.

**Data sources:**
- `$OMARCHY_PATH/default/hypr/bindings/{tiling,clipboard,utilities,media,applications}.lua` (read only)
- `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` (user bindings and overrides)

#### Hyprland Configurator

A dedicated Hyprland section with 69 curated settings across 4 categories, offering precise numeric, enum, color, and boolean control through guided input dialogs. Changes are written as managed blocks appended to config files using Hyprland's "last value wins" behavior, so they safely override defaults without touching original files.

**Edit dialogs** — press Space on any setting:
- **Bool** — toggles ON/OFF in-place, no dialog needed
- **Int/Float** — text input with range validation
- **Enum** — arrow-key option selection
- **Color** — text input supporting `rgba()`, `rgb()`, and gradients

Modified settings show a `*` prefix and `current > new` values. Press `R` to reset a pending edit. On confirm, settings are written as a Lua `hl.config({...})` block to `~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.lua` or `~/.config/hypr/input.lua` as appropriate, and Hyprland is reloaded and checked for config errors. Workspace swipe is written as an `hl.gesture(...)` binding.

Previous settings are detected on subsequent runs so you always see your current configuration.

**Config files written:**
- `~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.lua` — General, Decoration, and Gestures settings (managed block)
- `~/.config/hypr/input.lua` — Input settings (managed block)

#### Keyboard & Input

| Tweak | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Restore Caps Lock | Moves compose key to Right Alt, restores Caps Lock |
| Use Caps Lock for compose | Omarchy default - Caps Lock becomes compose key |

**Compose key combinations** (when using Caps Lock as compose):
- `Caps Lock + Space + Space` → em dash (—)
- `Caps Lock + m + s` → emoji picker
- `Caps Lock + Space + n` → custom name
- `Caps Lock + Space + e` → custom email

#### Monitor & Display

| Tweak | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Monitor scale | radio | Set 4K (GDK_SCALE=1.75, scale 1.666667) or 1080p/1440p (GDK_SCALE=1, no scaling) via the scale variables at the top of `monitors.lua` |
| Detect monitors | action | Scan connected displays and show resolution, scale, position, and make/model |
| Position monitors | action | Arrange multi-monitor layout with a guided step-by-step editor |
| Laptop display | toggle | Auto-disable laptop screen when an external display is connected |
| Primary monitor | action | Set which monitor gets workspace 1 by default |

##### Detect Monitors

Press Space on "Detect monitors" to open a full-screen dialog that runs `hyprctl monitors` and displays all connected outputs with their details:

- Name (e.g. `eDP-2`, `HDMI-A-1`)
- Resolution, scale, and current position
- Make/model description
- Laptop displays (eDP-*) are tagged with a `(laptop)` label

If 2 or more monitors are detected, press **I** to identify — each monitor flashes its name and number on-screen for 2 seconds using `hyprctl notify`, so you can tell which physical display is which.

##### Position Monitors

Press Space on "Position monitors" to open a guided multi-step editor for arranging your monitor layout. Requires 2+ monitors (auto-detects if not already scanned).

**Step 1 — Select primary monitor:** Choose which monitor sits at the origin (0,0) using arrow keys and Enter, then select its rotation (Normal, 90°, 180°, 270°).

**Step 2 — Place each remaining monitor:** For each unplaced monitor:
1. Select which already-placed monitor to position it relative to (arrow selection)
2. Choose direction: Right of / Left of / Above / Below (arrow selection)
3. Select rotation: Normal (landscape), 90° (portrait right), 180° (inverted), 270° (portrait left)
4. Position is calculated automatically using **scaled coordinates** (effective width = resolution / scale), with width and height swapped for 90°/270° rotations to match the rotated dimensions

**Step 3 — Preview & confirm:** Review all monitors with their calculated positions and rotations, then type `yes` to queue the layout.

On confirm, the layout is written to a managed `monitor-layout` block in `~/.config/hypr/monitors.lua`:
- One `hl.monitor({...})` rule per display, matched by its description (`desc:...`) so it follows the monitor if it moves to another port
- Each monitor's **current mode, refresh rate, VRR and bit depth are preserved** (e.g. a 170 Hz, 10-bit FreeSync panel stays that way)
- Omarchy's own catch-all rule still covers hot-plugged displays
- Timestamped backup of the previous config

Supports L-shaped and stacked layouts — each secondary monitor can be placed relative to any already-placed monitor, not just the primary.

The generic "Monitor scale" option (4K or 1080p/1440p) only changes Omarchy's default scale variables, so monitors with their own rule keep their settings.

##### Laptop Display Auto-Off

Toggle "Laptop display" to "Auto off" to automatically disable the laptop screen whenever an external display is connected, and re-enable it when unplugged.

**How it works:**

1. Creates a watcher script at `~/.config/hypr/scripts/laptop-display-auto.sh` that:
   - Detects the laptop display (eDP-*) and the backlight device (auto-detected from `/sys/class/backlight/`)
   - On external display connect: disables the laptop monitor via `hyprctl eval 'hl.monitor({...})'` and turns off the backlight via `brightnessctl`
   - On external display disconnect: restores the laptop monitor and brightness
   - Saves the current brightness level before turning off and restores it exactly
   - Monitors for plug/unplug events via Hyprland's IPC socket (falls back to `nc`, then 5-second polling if `socat` is unavailable)
   - Includes a 1-second debounce to prevent rapid event oscillation
2. Adds a `hyprland.start` hook to `~/.config/hypr/autostart.lua` (managed block) so the watcher starts automatically on login
3. Starts the watcher immediately (no logout required)

Toggle to "Normal" to disable: removes the watcher script, kills any running instance, removes the managed block from config, and re-enables the laptop display with restored brightness.

##### Primary Monitor

Press Space on "Primary monitor" to open an arrow-key selection dialog listing all connected monitors. Select which monitor should own workspace 1 (the default workspace).

On confirm:
1. Workspace 1 is moved to the selected monitor immediately
2. All other monitors are assigned incrementing workspaces (2, 3, ...) both live and persisted
3. The selection is persisted as `hl.workspace_rule({...})` rules (matched by monitor description) in a managed block in `~/.config/hypr/monitors.lua`

Requires 2+ monitors. If only one monitor is detected, the dialog shows a message and returns.

#### Appearance

All items below are in the **Appearance** category in the TUI.

| Tweak | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Enable rounded corners | Sets Hyprland `decoration.rounding = 8`; the Omarchy shell (bar, menus, notifications, OSD, lock screen) follows it automatically |
| Disable rounded corners | Returns to Omarchy's square corners |
| Remove window gaps | Maximize screen real estate |
| Restore window gaps | Return to default window spacing |
| Remove transparency | Adds a window rule that makes all windows fully opaque, overriding Omarchy's default and browser opacity |
| Restore transparency | Restore default window transparency rules |
| Show all tray icons | Pins every running tray app so its icon stays on the bar |
| Hide tray icons | Unpins them so they collapse into the tray drawer (Omarchy default) |
| Remove Omarchy logo | Remove the Omarchy logo menu button from the bar (the menu stays on SUPER+ALT+SPACE) |
| Restore Omarchy logo | Put the Omarchy logo menu button back at the left of the bar |
| Remove update icon | Remove the system update icon from the bar |
| Restore update icon | Put the system update icon back on the bar |
| Enable 12-hour clock | Clock displays with AM/PM |
| Disable 12-hour clock | 24-hour format |
| Show clock date | Display day name on clock (e.g. "Sunday 10:55 AM") |
| Hide clock date | Show time only (e.g. "10:55 AM") |
| Show window title | Display active window name next to workspaces |
| Hide window title | Remove active window name from the bar |
| Enable media directories | Screenshots → `~/Pictures/Screenshots`, Recordings → `~/Videos/Screencasts` (via `~/.config/uwsm/default`, applies after next login) |
| Disable media directories | Use default `~/Pictures` and `~/Videos` |

Bar tweaks edit `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` (through `omarchy bar` where possible); the shell picks up changes immediately.

#### System Features

| Tweak | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Enable suspend | Show suspend option in system menu |
| Disable suspend | Hide suspend from system menu |
| Enable hibernation | Creates swap subvolume matching RAM size |
| Disable hibernation | Removes hibernation support |
| Enable fingerprint auth | Set up fingerprint for sudo/login |
| Disable fingerprint auth | Remove fingerprint authentication |
| Enable FIDO2 auth | Set up security keys (YubiKey, etc.) |
| Disable FIDO2 auth | Remove security key authentication |
| Power profile | Set default power profile (power-saver, balanced, performance) restored on startup |
| Auto-switch profiles | Configure which profiles to use when AC power is connected or disconnected, or disable auto-switching entirely |
| Battery limit | Set maximum battery charge level (60%/70%/80%/90%/100%) with an Omarchy menu picker |

##### Power Profile

Press Space on "Power profile" to open an arrow-key selection dialog with three options:

- **Power saver** — reduces CPU frequency and brightness for maximum battery life
- **Balanced** — default profile balancing performance and power consumption
- **Performance** — maximum CPU performance at the cost of higher power draw

The dialog marks the currently active profile with `(active)` and any previously configured startup default with `(default)`.

On confirm, the selected profile is:
1. Applied immediately via `powerprofilesctl set`
2. Persisted across reboots by creating a startup script at `~/.config/hypr/scripts/power-profile-default.sh`
3. Auto-started on login via a `hyprland.start` hook in a managed block in `~/.config/hypr/autostart.lua`

Requires `power-profiles-daemon` (provides `powerprofilesctl`). If not installed, the dialog shows a graceful error message.

##### Auto-Switch Profiles

Press Space on "Auto-switch profiles" to open a configuration form with three settings:

- **Auto-switching** — toggle on or off
- **On AC power** — profile to apply when the charger is plugged in (Performance, Balanced, or Power saver)
- **On battery** — profile to apply when running on battery (Performance, Balanced, or Power saver)

When auto-switching is disabled, the Power Profile picker opens automatically so you can set a static startup profile in the same flow.

When enabled, a script is written to `~/.config/hypr/scripts/power-profile-auto-switch.sh` and a udev rule is installed at `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-power-profile.rules` that calls it whenever AC power is connected or disconnected. When disabled, the udev rule is removed.

Requires `power-profiles-daemon` and sudo access to write the udev rule.

##### Battery Charge Limit

Press Space on "Battery limit" to open an arrow-key selection dialog with five presets:

- **60%** — Maximum longevity
- **70%** — Good balance
- **80%** — Recommended
- **90%** — Slight protection
- **100%** — No limit (full charge)

The dialog marks the current sysfs threshold with `(current)` and any previously configured udev default with `(default)`.

On confirm, the selected limit is:
1. Applied immediately via `sudo tee` to `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/charge_control_end_threshold`
2. Persisted across reboots by writing a udev rule at `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-battery-charge-limit.rules`
3. Udev rules reloaded via `udevadm control --reload-rules`
4. Battery limit helper script installed at `~/.config/hypr/scripts/omarchy-battery-limit.sh`
5. A **Setup > Battery Limit** picker added to the Omarchy menu (`~/.config/omarchy/extensions/omarchy-menu.jsonc`)

Setting 100% (no limit) removes the udev rule, helper script, and menu picker.

Requires a battery with kernel-exposed `charge_control_end_threshold` support. If not available, the dialog shows a graceful error message.

##### Omarchy Menu Integration

When a battery charge limit is set (any value other than 100%), the Omarchy menu gets a **Setup > Battery Limit** submenu listing the five presets, with a ✓ next to the active one. Picking one applies it through the helper script:

- Changing the limit uses `pkexec` for authentication (GUI-friendly, no terminal needed)
- The udev rule is updated so the new limit survives reboots
- A desktop notification confirms the change
- The submenu only appears on machines that expose `charge_control_end_threshold`

#### Utilities

| Tweak | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Backup config | action | Create a timestamped backup of your Omarchy configuration |
| Menu shortcut | toggle | Add or remove A La Carchy from the Omarchy launcher menu |

### ROG Hardware Control

Full ASUS ROG laptop control via `asusctl`, organized into two subcategories. Requires `asusctl` (part of the `asusctl` package). If not installed, dialogs show a graceful error message.

#### ROG Hardware

| Tweak | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Platform profile | action | Set ASUS performance profile (Quiet/Balanced/Performance) via `asusctl profile set` |
| Fan curves | toggle | Enable or disable custom fan curves for the active profile |
| Fan curve editor | action | Visual graph editor for CPU/GPU fan curves with 8 adjustable points |
| Boot sound | toggle | Enable or disable the POST boot sound via firmware attributes |
| Panel overdrive | toggle | Reduce display ghosting with panel overdrive (may increase power use) |
| Discrete GPU | toggle | Enable or disable the dedicated NVIDIA GPU |
| GPU MUX | radio | Switch between dGPU direct and hybrid mode (reboot required) |
| Battery management | action | Set battery charge limit and one-shot full charge |
| Power tuning | action | Adjust CPU/GPU power and thermal limits via firmware attributes |

##### Platform Profile

Press Space on "Platform profile" to open an arrow-key selection dialog with three options:

- **Quiet** — reduced fan noise and lower performance
- **Balanced** — default profile balancing performance and thermals
- **Performance** — maximum performance with higher fan speeds

The dialog marks the currently active profile with `(active)`. On confirm, the profile is applied immediately via `asusctl profile set`.

##### Fan Curve Editor

Press Space to open a visual graph editor for fan curves:
- **Edit CPU/GPU fan curves** — interactive ASCII graph showing the current 8-point curve
  - Left/Right arrows to select a point on the curve
  - Up/Down arrows to adjust fan speed (0-100%)
  - T key to edit the temperature value (°C) for the selected point
  - S key to toggle adjustment step size (±1%, ±5%, ±10%)
  - Graph displays real-time with percentage scale and temperature axis
  - Percentages are converted to/from PWM values automatically
- **Reset to default** — restore the active profile's fan curves to factory defaults

The editor loads the current curve from asusctl and shows the active profile for reference. Applied via `asusctl fan-curve --mod-profile --fan --data` and `--default`. Setting a custom curve automatically enables it for the specified fan.

##### Firmware Attributes

Boot sound, panel overdrive, discrete GPU, and GPU MUX are controlled via `asusctl armoury set` which writes directly to ASUS firmware attributes. Changes take effect immediately (GPU MUX requires a reboot). Fan curves are toggled via `asusctl fan-curve --enable-fan-curves` for the active performance profile.

##### Battery Management

Press Space to open a dialog with two options:
- **Set charge limit** — set the battery charge limit between 20-100% to extend battery longevity (applied via `asusctl battery limit`)
- **One-shot full charge** — temporarily override the charge limit for a single full charge cycle (applied via `asusctl battery oneshot`)

The dialog shows the current charge limit for reference.

##### Power Tuning

Press Space to open a multi-parameter editor for CPU/GPU power and thermal limits:

| Parameter | Range | Default | Description |

Each zone can be independently enabled for **Boot**, **Awake**, **Sleep**, and **Shutdown** states. Applied via `asusctl aura power <zone>` with `--boot`, `--awake`, `--sleep`, `--shutdown` flags.

##### Slash Ledbar

Press Space to open a dialog with options to:
- **Enable/Disable** the Slash LED bar
- **Select animation mode** from 16 available animations (Static, Bounce, Slash, Loading, BitStream, Transmission, Flow, Flux, Phantom, Spectrum, Hazard, Interfacing, Ramp, GameOver, Start, Buzzer) — selecting a mode automatically enables the Slash Ledbar
- **Set brightness** (0-255) when enabling or changing mode

Applied via `asusctl slash --enable/--disable`, `--mode`, and `-l` flags.

##### Slash Options

Press Space to configure additional Slash Ledbar behavior:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Interval | Animation interval (0-5) |
| Show on boot | Show the animation during boot |
| Show on shutdown | Show the animation during shutdown |
| Show on sleep | Show the animation during sleep |
| Show on battery | Show the animation when on battery power |
| Battery warning | Show the low-battery warning animation |

Toggle options cycle through Enable/Disable. Applied via `asusctl slash` with `-B`, `-S`, `-s`, `-b`, `-w`, and `--interval` flags.

##### AniMe Matrix

Toggle to enable or disable the AniMe Matrix LED display on the laptop lid. Applied via `asusctl anime --enable-display true/false`.

##### AniMe Options

Press Space to configure additional AniMe Matrix behavior:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Brightness | Set display brightness (off/low/med/high) |
| Powersave animation | Enable or disable the builtin powersave animation |
| Off when unplugged | Turn off when external power is disconnected |
| Off when suspended | Turn off when the laptop suspends |
| Off when lid closed | Turn off when the lid is closed |
| Builtin animations | Choose animations for boot, awake, sleep, and shutdown states |

The builtin animations dialog walks through four phases, each with preset options:
- **Boot** — default, GlitchConstruction, StaticEmergence
- **Awake** — default, BinaryBannerScroll, RogLogoGlitch
- **Sleep** — default, BannerSwipe, Starfield
- **Shutdown** — default, GlitchOut, SeeYa

Applied via `asusctl anime` with `--brightness`, `--enable-powersave-anim`, `--off-when-unplugged`, `--off-when-suspended`, `--off-when-lid-closed`, and `asusctl anime set-builtins`.

### Themarchy

Generate and apply a full Omarchy theme from your current wallpaper's colors.

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Apply from wallpaper | Extracts colors, generates a palette, and applies it as the active theme |
| Keybind SUPER+SHIFT+T | Toggle the keybind that triggers Themarchy instantly from anywhere |

#### How It Works

1. **Color extraction** — [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) (`wal -i "$WALLPAPER" -n -q`) generates a 16-color palette from the wallpaper and writes it to `~/.cache/wal/colors.json`
2. **Palette mapping** — a Python script reads the pywal JSON and maps `special.background`, `special.foreground`, `special.cursor`, and `colors.color0–color15` into `colors.toml`, with `color5` used as the `accent`
3. **Theme application** — the current wallpaper is copied into the theme's `backgrounds/` folder, then `omarchy-theme-set themarchy` applies the palette to all Omarchy components (terminals, the Omarchy shell bar/menus/notifications/lock screen, Hyprland borders)

#### Wallpaper detection

Themarchy reads `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/background` (the Omarchy background symlink).

#### Files created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/hypr/scripts/themarchy.sh` | Deployed standalone script (run directly or via keybind) |
| `~/.config/omarchy/themes/themarchy/colors.toml` | Generated color palette consumed by `omarchy-theme-set-templates` |
| `~/.config/omarchy/themes/themarchy/backgrounds/` | Wallpaper copy so the background persists after the theme swap |

Requires `python-pywal` (AUR) and `python3`. If pywal is not installed, A La Carchy will offer to install it automatically via yay or paru.

### Extra Themes

Browse and install 246 community-made themes directly from the TUI. Themes are sourced from the [Omarchy Extra Themes](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/90/extra-themes) directory and installed via `omarchy-theme-install`.

- Already-installed themes are marked with `(installed)` and skipped during installation
- The last theme installed becomes the active theme
- Themes are installed to `~/.config/omarchy/themes/`
- Press `A` to select/deselect all themes at once
- Themes that require GitHub authentication are automatically skipped after a timeout

### Backup Config

Creates a timestamped archive (`~/omarchy-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`) of your Omarchy configuration directories:

- `~/.config/hypr/`
- `~/.config/omarchy/`
- `~/.config/uwsm/`
- `~/.config/fastfetch/`
- `~/.config/alacritty/`
- `~/.config/kitty/`
- `~/.config/ghostty/`
- `~/.config/foot/`

Directories that don't exist are skipped.

Also generates `~/restore-omarchy-config.sh` — a self-contained script to restore from any previous backup. Symlinks are followed so the actual file content is preserved in the backup.

#### Backup Timing

When backup is selected alongside configuration tweaks, you'll be prompted to choose when to back up:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Before changes | Preserve current state as a rollback point |
| After changes | Save the new configuration |
| Both | Full safety net — before and after |

If backup is the only selection (no tweaks), it runs immediately.

#### Restoring from Backup

Run the restore script to choose from all available backups:

```bash
bash ~/restore-omarchy-config.sh
```

The restore script lists all backups with dates and sizes, letting you select which one to restore:

```
Available backups:

  1) 2026-02-11 14:30:15  (12K)
  2) 2026-02-11 14:28:42  (12K)

Select a backup to restore (1-2):
```

### Menu Shortcut

Adds an "A La Carchy" entry to the Omarchy launcher menu (SUPER+ALT+SPACE) so you can launch the TUI without remembering the curl command.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Add | Adds an `alacarchy` entry to `~/.config/omarchy/extensions/omarchy-menu.jsonc` (managed block) |
| Remove | Removes the managed block |

The entry launches this checkout when A La Carchy was run from a file, or the published one-liner otherwise. The menu is refreshed immediately with `omarchy menu refresh`.

## Safety Features

- Never run as root (uses sudo only when needed)
- Confirmation prompt before every action
- Shows exactly what will be removed
- Uses `-Rns` flags to remove dependencies safely
- Timestamped backups created before modifying any config file
- Backup runs before any config modifications when selected with tweaks
- Config backup follows symlinks to preserve actual file content
- Restore script lists all backups and lets you choose which to restore
- Restore script prompts for confirmation before overwriting
- Idempotent operations - skips actions already applied

## Package Names

The script uses the following package name mappings:

| Application | Package Name |

## Configuration Files Modified

All edits to shared config files live in marked blocks (`-- >>> a-la-carchy <name>` … `-- <<< a-la-carchy <name>`), so they can be updated or removed cleanly. A timestamped backup is taken before each change. Files under `$OMARCHY_PATH` (`/usr/share/omarchy`) are only read, never modified.

| File | Used for |
|------|----------|
| `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` | Keybinding toggles, Themarchy keybind, keybind editor overrides |
| `~/.config/hypr/monitors.lua` | Monitor scale variables, multi-monitor layout, primary monitor workspace rules |
| `~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.lua` | Rounded corners, window gaps, transparency, Hyprland General/Decoration/Gestures settings |
| `~/.config/hypr/input.lua` | Compose key, Alt/Super swap, Hyprland Input settings |
| `~/.config/hypr/autostart.lua` | Laptop auto-off watcher and power profile startup hooks |
| `~/.config/hypr/scripts/themarchy.sh` | Themarchy standalone script (created by Themarchy section) |
| `~/.config/hypr/scripts/laptop-display-auto.sh` | Laptop auto-off watcher script (created/removed by toggle) |
| `~/.config/hypr/scripts/power-profile-default.sh` | Power profile startup script (sets default profile on login) |
| `~/.config/hypr/scripts/omarchy-battery-limit.sh` | Battery limit helper for the Omarchy menu (uses pkexec, created/removed by battery limit) |
| `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` | Bar tweaks: tray, logo, update icon, clock format/date, window title |
| `~/.config/omarchy/extensions/omarchy-menu.jsonc` | Menu shortcut and battery limit picker |
| `~/.config/uwsm/default` | Screenshot/recording directories |
| `~/.local/state/omarchy/toggles/suspend-off` | Suspend availability in the system menu |
| `$OMARCHY_PATH/default/hypr/bindings/*.lua` | Read by keybind editor (not modified) |

## Troubleshooting

### "No AUR helper detected"
Install yay or paru:
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

### Package name doesn't match
If a package name is incorrect, you can edit the `PACKAGES` array in the script to match your system's actual package names.

## After Removal

After removing packages, you may want to clean up:

```bash
# Clean package cache
yay -Sc

# Remove orphaned packages
yay -Yc
```
